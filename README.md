# Scam Mail Detection

## Overview

This project is a machine learning-based scam email detection system. I leveraged datasets from Kaggle and Zenodo, providing a diverse and up-to-date range of scam emails from 1998 to 2022. The goal is to build a practical model for detecting scam emails using Python and Google Colab.

## Features

- Utilizes machine learning techniques for scam email detection.
- Integrates datasets from Kaggle and Zenodo for comprehensive coverage.
- A practical project to enhance understanding of machine learning in real-world applications.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python
- Jupyter Notebooks
