# Scam Mail Detection

## Overview

This project is a machine learning-based scam email detection system. I leveraged datasets from Kaggle and Zenodo, providing a diverse and up-to-date range of scam emails from 1998 to 2022. The goal is to build a practical model for detecting scam emails using Python and Google Colab.

## Features

- **Machine Learning Techniques:** The system employs state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to analyze and classify emails, distinguishing between legitimate and potentially harmful content.

- **Dataset Integration:** The inclusion of datasets from Kaggle and Zenodo ensures a comprehensive coverage of scam emails, capturing variations and trends in fraudulent activities over the years.

- **Practical Application:** This project goes beyond theoretical concepts, focusing on real-world applications to enhance understanding and proficiency in machine learning practices.
